      Building on the success of the open-source [**Flows for APEX**](flows4apex/) project, we introduce the **Flows for APEX Enterprise Edition** -- the latest features of Flows for APEX with  **additional functionality**, and coming with **product support** and an **annual advisory session** with the product team.  The Flows for APEX Enterprise Edition is available from Flowquest on an annual subscription basis.
