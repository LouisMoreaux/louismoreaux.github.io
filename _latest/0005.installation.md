#### Additional step to use timers
##### Grant create job
Your schema need to have the privilege "create job" to use the timers feature of Flows for APEX. As SYS, you have to run the following command:
```sql
grant create job to <my_workspace_schema>;
```
##### Create timers job
We provide a SQL script in the distribution to enable the timer feature. Run enable_timers.sql (app_dist/Applications/Enable_Timers) in your schema with SQLcl or using the SQL Workshop in the APEX builder.
