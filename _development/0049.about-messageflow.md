### BPMN MessageFlow

#### Introduction 

While most of our process diagrams define how one task follows another inside a single process instance, message flow allows one instance to send, receive, or wait for a message from another process instance. In BPMN, this is called MessageFlow.

BPMN process diagrams use BPMN SequenceFlow, drawn with solid lines, to define flow between tasks, events, and gateways within a process instance. If a BPMN participation is used (a set of lanes), flow within the participation (lane set) must use only sequenceFlow. Communication between different lanesets or different process instances must use MessageFlow, drawn with dashed lines, instead..

#### Simple Message Protocol

Flows for APEX introduces a formatted message protocol that can be used to define these message flows. We call this protocol `simple message protocol`. The simple message protocol specifies the message header, used to identify the message. This contains three components, which must be known by both the sender and the receiver prior to the message being sent. 
1. message name / type, 
2. message key, 
3. key value. 
   
In addition, the message can optionally contain a payload, or message body, which can send information that is currently unknown to the receiver. The payload could be a text value, or a JSON object containing several values.

#### Messaging - BPMN Objects

BPMN, and Flows for APEX, allows you to define messaging using

- Tasks : sendTask and receiveTask 
- Events : message throwEvent and message catchEvent

![MessageFlow Objects]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/messageFlow-objects.png "MessageFlow objects include Message Throw and Catch Events, Send Tasks and Receive Tasks").

You can choose to use tasks or events, and individual analysts or companies will often have their own style guides. Both are supported and provide equivalent functionality in Flows for APEX. We tend to favour the use of event syntax as a more modern style. 

#### Supported Objects in Flows for APEX v 23.1

The initial release of message flow supports:
- Send Task
- Receive Task
- Intermediate Message Throw Event
- Intermediate Message Catch Event 

The following events are not yet supported in this release:
- Message Start Event
- Boundary Event Message Catch Event
- Message Throw End Event

#### Subscriptions 

When a message receiveTask or a message catch event become the current object in a process instance, they create a `message subscription` which defines the message that they are waiting for.

The `message subscription` defines 

- the `simple message protocol` headers required to identify an incoming message, which are:
  - the message name
  - a key name
  - a key value
- information to identify the subscribing receiveTask / messageCatchEvent
  - the process id of the waiting process
  - the subflow id of the waiting object
  - the step key for that object
  - the handler to use for the waiting step type
- information on what to do with any received payload
  - which process variable to store any payload into

These are stored in the Flows for APEX table `flow_subscriptions`.

#### MessageFlow Operation

| Serial | Current Process (Receiver) | Message Subscription | Remote Process (Sender) |
| --- | --- | ---| --- | 
| 1 | ReceiveTask or Message Catch Event beomes current step | Creates a Message Subscription for the Message  | -|
| 2 | Step waits to receive incoming messsage | - | - |
| 3 |  - | - | Remote Process prepares and sends a message containing the required Message Name, Key Name, and Key Value, along with any payload |
|4 | - | Engine looks for 100% match between received message (message name, key name, key value) and its Message Subscriptions. | - |
|5 a | - | no matching subscription found - returns error to Sender | Sender handles.  Failed message logged. |
| or <p>5 b | - | 100% match found - looks up call back information (process id, subflow id, step key, handler) and uses this to store payload into process variable and then call the subscribing step.  Logs succesful message. | - |
| 6 | Calling Step issues a `complete_step` and steps forward | Message Subscription is deleted now it has been consumed | Sender carrys on...|
