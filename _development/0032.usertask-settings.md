### Setting Up an APEX Page UserTask

APEX Page Usertasks put a link to an APEX page into the Task List when they become the current object.  The page link includes page item and values to be set.  The Task is managed by Flows for APEX.

APEX Page User Tasks:  APEX Page userTasks are configured in the APEX Page tab of the Flows for APEX flow modeler properties panel with the information required to call an APEX page.  

![configuration of userTasks]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/usertask-page-settings1.png "screeenshot of configuring APEX Page userTasks in the Flows for APEX modeler")

#### Task Type

`Task Type` should be set to APEX Page.

#### APEX Page

These settings control the page that is called, the APEX items that are set and their values, along with APEX cache and request settings.  Most of these settings will be familiar to anyone who has configured APEX menus.

The Modeler can make use of APEX metadata already stored in the database about your application and its objects.  You can toggle the `Use APEX metadata` switch on or off as you configure the page link.

Select the `Application` and `Page` that you want this task link to call, either from the APEX metadata or by entering an applicationID and a Page number in that app.

`Page Items`. Creates one or more APEX Items that should be set, along with the values to set them to. 
 - Press the green `Generate default items` to add items for `PROCESS_ID`, `SUBFLOW_ID`, and `STEP_KEY`.  We assume in our default that you have created these as APEX application items in your application, and we want the user to set these items when starting to work on a task, because they will need to supply those values back to Flows for APEX when they complete their task.
 - Use the '+' button to add other items to be set in the calling page, along with the required values.
 - The following items are available to be substituted into the Item Values string at runtime:

    - Flows for APEX Process Variables (of type varchar2).
        These are specified using the syntax `&F4A$<variable_name>.`
        &F4A$ is required to be upper case.
        Note the trailing period '.'.
        Note also that substitution currently only works on process variables of type   `varchar2`, due to format translation issues on dates and numbers.
    - Flows for APEX Pseudo Variables.
        The current Process ID, Subflow ID, and Step Key are also available as pseudo  variables.  These are specified as `&F4A$PROCESS_ID.` , `&F4A$SUBFLOW_ID.`  and `&F4A$STEP_KEY.` respectively.

#### Variable Expressions

A UserTask can have [variable expressions]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.collection }}/variable-expression/ "link to information about variable expressions") that execute before the task starts and after the task completes.

#### Task Assignment

This is where you define who the possible users are that will perform the task.  This is defined as a list of `potential users`, a list of `potential groups`, as well as a list of `excluded users` who cannot perform the task.  Assignment can be defined with a static value, as the name of a proess variable containing the information, by a SQL Query, a PL/SQL expression or function body returning the required value.

If Lanes are being used on your diagram, the Lane is defined as mapping to an APEX Role, and no explicit task assignment is defined in this section, the task will be assigned to the lane role.  

#### Scheduling

This controls the settings for task due date and task priority.   These control how items appear in the Task List - list sorting, markings as high priority, overdue, etc.

### Setting up an APEX Approval UserTask

APEX Approval Tasks:  APEX Approval userTasks are configured in the APEX Approvals tab of the Flows for APEX Flow Modeler properties panel. Select the Task Definition to be used and then pass information to the task.  You also specify a Flows for APEX process variable to receive the approval result.  APEX Approvals are only supported on Oracle APEX v22.1 and above.

![configuration of Approval userTask]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/configureUserTaskApproval.png "configuring APEX Approval userTasks in the Flows for APEX modeler")

To specify a Task Definition, you must first configure one in your APEX application.  These can be found in the Shared Components section of the Application Builder.  You should normally add a parameter to the Task Definition to store the Flows for APEX Process ID, to act as a reference back to Flows for APEX.

- Input:  This can be toggled between 'Manual Input', which allows you to directly enter configuration data, and 'Use APEX meta data', where the flow modeler will use the APEX application meta data to populate list of values providing valid choices.   You can freely toggle between these two positions as you complete individual configuration items.
- Application: If you are using APEX meta data, pick the application containing the Task Definition from the pull down menu.  If you are using manual input, specify the Application ID.
- Task Definition:  If you are using APEX Meta data, select the Task Definition from the pull down menu.  If you are using manual entry, enter the static ID of it.
- Subject: This will create the subject heading for the approval on a page of type Unified Task List.  If you leave this empty, the heading specified in the Task Definition will be used.  If specified in Flows for APEX, the subject can contain items that are substituted by Flows for APEX (using the &F4A$var_name. syntax), as well as Task Definition parameters (using the &parameter. syntax).
- Business Reference: This can be used ie. to pass the primary key of the subject record from Flows for APEX to the approval task in APEX. In Flows for APEX, the subject primary key is normally kept in the BUSINESS_REF process variable to link a process instance to its systems of record.  **
- Parameters: This is where you specify the input parameters to be passed into the Task Definition.  This will contain the task 'payload', as well as the Flows for APEX Process ID. **
- Priority: By default, the Approval User Task will operate with the priority specified in the APEX Task Definition.  If you want to override this, you can specify a priority here.  **
- Initiator:  By default, the task will be initiated by the current APEX user. If you need to override this, you can specify this. **
- ** These can all be specified using a Flows for APEX process variable, which will be substituted.
