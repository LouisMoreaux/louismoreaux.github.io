##### 2a. APEX Page UserTask

APEX Page User Tasks:  APEX Page userTasks are configured in the APEX Page tab of the Flows for APEX flow modeler properties panel with the information required to call an APEX page.  This configuration will be familiar to anyone who has configured APEX menus.

Page Items contains a comma-separated list of items to be set in the calling page.

Item Values contains a comma-separated list of values to be supplied.  The following items are available to be substituted into the Item Values string at runtime:

- Flows for APEX Process Variables (of type varchar2).
  These are specified using the syntax `&F4A$<variable_name>.`
  &F4A$ is required to be upper case.
  Note the trailing period '.'.
  Note also that substitution currently only works on process variables of type `varchar2`, due to format translation issues on dates and numbers.
- Flows for APEX Pseudo Variables.
  The current Process ID, Subflow ID, and Step Key are also available as pseudo variables.
  These are specified as `&F4A$PROCESS_ID.` , `&F4A$SUBFLOW_ID.`  and `&F4A$STEP_KEY.`  respectively.

Note that you will need to pass the Process_ID, Subflow_ID, and Step Key to a page as its context.  The page will need these step the process forward when it is finished, using a flow_step_complete call.

##### 2b. APEX Approval UserTask

APEX Approval Tasks:  APEX Approval userTasks are configured in the APEX Approvals tab of the Flows for APEX Flow Modeler properties panel. Select the Task Definition to be used and then pass information to the task.  You also specify a Flows for APEX process variable to receive the approval result.  APEX Approvals are only supported on Oracle APEX v22.1 and above.

To specify a Task Definition, you must first configure one in your APEX application.  These can be found in the Shared Components section of the Application Builder.  You should normally add a parameter to the Task Definition to store the Flows for APEX Process ID, to act as a reference back to Flows for APEX.

- Input:  This can be toggled between 'Manual Input', which allows you to directly enter configuration data, and 'Use APEX meta data', where the flow modeler will use the APEX application meta data to populate list of values providing valid choices.   You can freely toggle between these two positions as you complete individual configuration items.
- Application: If you are using APEX meta data, pick the application containing the Task Definition from the pull down menu.  If you are using manual input, specify the Application ID.
- Task Definition:  If you are using APEX Meta data, select the Task Definition from the pull down menu.  If you are using manual entry, enter the static ID of it.
- Subject: This will create the subject heading for the approval on a page of type Unified Task List.  If you leave this empty, the heading specified in the Task Definition will be used.  If specified in Flows for APEX, the subject can contain items that are substituted by Flows for APEX (using the &F4A$var_name. syntax), as well as Task Definition parameters (using the &parameter. syntax).
- Business Reference: This can be used ie. to pass the primary key of the subject record from Flows for APEX to the approval task in APEX. In Flows for APEX, the subject primary key is normally kept in the BUSINESS_REF process variable to link a process instance to its systems of record.  **
- Parameters: This is where you specify the input parameters to be passed into the Task Definition.  This will contain the task 'payload', as well as the Flows for APEX Process ID. **
- Priority: By default, the Approval User Task will operate with the priority specified in the APEX Task Definition.  If you want to override this, you can specify a priority here.  **
- Initiator:  By default, the task will be initiated by the current APEX user. If you need to override this, you can specify this. **
- ** These can all be specified using a Flows for APEX process variable, which will be substituted.
