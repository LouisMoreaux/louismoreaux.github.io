# Flows for APEX Configuration Parameter Options

Configuration parameters can be changed from the Flows for APEX application using the `Configuration` menu.

### Configuring Event Logging

Event logging is currently designed to be configurable, so that an installation can capture more or less event data depending upon business ad security needs.

Logging is configured using Flows for APEX configuration parameters, which are stored in the FLOW_CONFIGURATION table.

The storage location is specified using a JSON snippet, which can be editted in the Flows for APEX application.  ` Note:` This storage parameter is for archiving of BPMN Diagrams.   A similar parameter exists in the Archiving section to define the storage location of Instance Archive files.|

### Default APEX Session Configuration for Asynchronous Calls

These parameters are used to create an APEX session for non-APEX originated calls to Flows for APEX.  An APEX session is required for correct operation of ceratin features, incuding:

- correct operation of Variable Expressions of type PL/SQL Expression and PL/SQL Function Body
- generation of debug files
- Gateway Routing Expressions

Default parameters are used if session configuration has not been provided in either process variables (on a timer), or in the Process Diagram.  The values provided in the system configuraton will be used if no other sets of session config data is found.  Administrators of high security systems may want to leave these configuration parameters unset, so that specific values have to be provided at call or diagram level.  Any calls made without call level or diagram level parameters will then raise an error -- which might be what you want rather than relying on system-level dafault parameters.
