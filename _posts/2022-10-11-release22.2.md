Flows for APEX 22.2 is now available for download at [flowsforapex.org](https://flowsforapex.org). This major release has a lot of new functionality to offer, including:
- Support for Call Activities in BPMN 2.0
- Gateway Path Expressions
- Integration with the Approval Task Component in APEX 22.1+
- Language support for Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish and German

Richard Allen demonstrated key features of 22.2 in the APEX Office Hours session of 29-SEP. For those of you that missed that session, you can watch a replay [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlbRRvK9QjI).

Minimum requirements for installation are Oracle DB 19c+ and Oracle APEX 20.1+. For a quick start, I suggest to install it in a free workspace on [https://apex.oracle.com](https://apex.oracle.com).

We have also updated the sample app “Expense Claims” that ships with the software distribution to reflect most of the new features in 22.2.
If you are new to BPMN 2.0, I recommend looking at the preinstalled tutorials in the Flows for APEX app.
