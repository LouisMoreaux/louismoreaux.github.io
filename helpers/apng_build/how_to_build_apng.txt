Animated PNG (apng) files are a good way to show a multi-step sequence in a single image on the website.

To make an apng file:

1.  download apngasm from github.  

    https://github.com/apngasm/apngasm/tree/master

    for MacOS, I used the latest apngasm use homebrew: brew install apngasm.

2.  Create  / Capture a series of png files containing the images you want to show.  
    Note that these png files must of be IDENTICAL pixel size.   If the pixel sizes are different, it will just not give you any output (with no helpful message!)

3.  CLI option:

    apngasm -o output.png file1.png file2.png file3.png 

    to have all screens progress at 1 image per 2 seconds add -d 2000 (default 2000 mS)

    Assemble an APNG with specific frame delays in miliseconds:

        apngasm -o outfile.png frame1.png 200 frame2.png 100 [options]

    Assemble an APNG with specific frame delays in fractions of a second:

        apngasm -o outfile.png frame1.png 1:2 frame2.png 3:5 [options]

    To loop infinitely -l 0
    To loop 20 times then stop -l20

4.  JSON Build file option (seems useful for more complex animations where you might edit a few times, and want to modify in a later release...)
    I think this JSON thing might be a ChatGPT Halucination as I can't make this work, and can't find any doc for it ....

    4a.   create a json file apng.json

        {
          "files": [
            {
              "file": "frame1_resized.png",
              "delay": 10
            },
            {
              "file": "frame2_resized.png",
              "delay": 20
            },
            {
              "file": "frame3_resized.png",
              "delay": 10
            }
          ],
          "output": "output.apng",
          "loop": 0
        }

    4b.  run apngasm with the json input  (not sure this is correct)

        apngasm -o output.apng @apng.json

Good Luck!
